## 🎬 THE DEMO: Real-Time Chaos on $2 Silicon

While the industry slept, we broke the line.
We mapped the **Lorenz Attractor (Chaos Theory)** on a Python Brain and streamed it to an ESP8266 Muscle with **Zero Latency**.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

This repository contains the **Architecture Demo** structure.

### 1. Hardware Requirements
* **Brain:** PC / Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano (Running Python 3.8+)
* **Muscle:** ESP8266 / ESP32 (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
* **Connection:** USB Serial Cable (Baud Rate 115200)

### 2. Software Setup
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Antman-Atomic-Chaos-Control.git
cd Antman-Atomic-Chaos-Control
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Flash the Muscle
Open `src/atomic_muscle/atomic_muscle.ino` in Arduino IDE and flash it to your ESP8266 board.

### 4. Run the Brain
Execute the Antman Core Logic to initiate the Neural Link:

```bash
python src/antman_brain.py
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE ON SOURCE CODE

**This repository demonstrates the ARCHITECTURE only.**

The **Core Physics Engine (God Mode)** and the **Koopman Solver** algorithms are locked in the **Sanctuary**. We do not distribute weapon-grade control logic to anonymous users.

### ⚔️ Want the REAL Code?

If you are a builder (not a ghost), prove your worth:

1.  Build the Phase 1 hardware setup (ESP8266 + Serial).
2.  Record a video of it working (even a basic test).
