## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report bugs or vulnerabilities.**

What you perceive as a "bug" or "missing code" is intentional.
The Core Physics Engine (God Mode) is stripped from this repository for security reasons.

If the code does not run, it is because you lack the **Sanctuary Key**.

### ❌ Do not open Issues.
### ❌ Do not email us asking for the code.

### ✅ Solution:
If you want the full working system, apply for the Sanctuary:
